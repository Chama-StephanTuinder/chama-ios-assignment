## iOS Assignment

### Introduction
Create an iOS app that will fetch the current exchange rate of Bitcoin / EUR and display the data in a clear User Interface.

### Time/Format
The assignment is intentionally made too big, we suggest you spend a maximum of 5 hours on it. We would like you to demonstrate the parts you did finish, on your own laptop. Please submit your code and after we review it we will plan a moment for you to Present it to the team. For the presentation, please prepare a 15-20 minute of presentation, explaining what you did and especially how you would take it further to completion: we want you to not only demonstrate how you code, but also how you transfer knowledge. The rest of the time (40-45 minutes) we will talk about the assignment, how you did it.

### Requirements

- Write assignment in the latest version of Swift.
- Implement using an architectural design pattern of your choice.
- Display the current exchange rate in a view.
- Display the historical data for the past two weeks.
- Daily data, 1 value per day.
- Use 3rd party libraries if you have to, but be prepared to argument why that library was necessary.

### Nice to have
- Provide live-update for the current exchange rate.
- Cache / persist the latest data to be shown upon app launch, before fetching latest values.
- Provide some test coverage.

### Extra
Review of this assignment will focus on technical implementation, so don't go overboard on the UI. However it never hurts to show you can provide a neat and balanced interface with minimal implementation.

- Please attach the presentation file (pdf, ppt, keynote, google slides link) inside your project/repository test.
